==========================
RST formatting conventions
==========================

OpenStack documentation uses reStructuredText (RST) markup syntax
with Sphinx extensions.

RST is a powerful and straightforward markup language, which in combination
with Sphinx provides a wide range of facilities for the intelligent and
good-looking documentation creation. It uses simple and implicit
markuping to introduce a wide range of content elements, such as, titles,
code blocks, vertical lists, and many others.

All the source content formatted using RST is stored in files with
the ``.rst`` extension.

To keep the documentation format consistent, follow the guidelines
included in this chapter for all the RST source content.
